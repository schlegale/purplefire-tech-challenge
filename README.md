# Welcome to My Tech Challenge!

Hello and welcome! This repository contains a web application created with Next.js, utilizing both Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR) to deliver a dynamic and responsive user experience.

## Getting Started

To dive into this application, you'll need to follow a few simple steps to get it up and running on your local development environment.

### Installation

First things first, clone this repository to your local machine. Once you have the repository cloned, navigate into the project's root directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the dependencies required for the app to run.

### Running the Application

To start the application in development mode, which offers live reloading and debugging capabilities, simply run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command fires up a development server, allowing you to test and iterate on the application in real-time.

## Application Structure

The application consists of two distinct pages, each designed to showcase different functionalities and design principles. To achieve this, components are organized into separate folders based on their relevance to each page.

### Pages and Components

- **Home/Landing Page**: Located under `app/page.tsx`, this is the first page users will encounter. Accompanying components specific to this page can be found in `app/components`.

- **Products Page**: Accessible at `app/products/[name]/page.tsx`, this page is designed to display product details dynamically. Like the homepage, its components reside in a similarly structured folder within the same path for consistency and ease of navigation.

## Updates

Should there be any updates or additions to the application, rest assured that this README will be promptly updated to reflect those changes. Keep an eye out for any announcements!

## Final Thoughts

Thank you for taking the time to explore this application. I hope you enjoy testing it as much as I enjoyed developing it. Good luck, and I look forward to any feedback you might have!
